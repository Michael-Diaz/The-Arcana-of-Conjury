# The Arcana of Conjury

Inspired to put the knowledge gained during highschool and my early college years in coding to use,
I set out to create a personal project on a scale that I could take pride in. Eventually I settled on
the design of a magic-based Role Playing Game, or RPG. Using what I've learned so far, I aim to
create a one-of-a-kind experience for the player- yet still familiar enough for anyone to pick up and
enjoy.
